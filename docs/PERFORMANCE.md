# Performance Optimization Guide

## API Optimization
- Response caching for duplicate requests
- Connection pooling for database
- Async I/O for non-blocking operations
- Model inference batching

## Model Optimization
- Feature engineering optimization
- Model quantization for faster inference
- ONNX runtime for production

## Monitoring
- Track p50, p95, p99 latencies
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Database query performance
